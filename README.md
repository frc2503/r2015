Our code for the 2015 season and following off-season.

This code was run on our robot at the Lake Superior Regional and is currently being worked-on for reference and practice.

This README is intended as a complicated set of instructions for this repository, which will likely apply to future robot code projects.

## Contributing

To contribute to this GitHub account, you must first have the code cloned on your workstation!
If you have yet to install the FRC development suite, you can do this by following the [2015 FRC Control System][FRC Control System] steps.
Since this robot program is written in Java, specifically follow the directions for "FRC Java Programming;" there isn't much need for the C++ or LabVIEW stuff since we don't use it.
